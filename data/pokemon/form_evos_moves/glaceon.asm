; Evolutions - never read through this record. Evolution stays
; species-keyed (the form's own bits ride along in the block-copied
; party struct), so it already evolves correctly through the
; species-keyed EvosMovesPointerTable. This terminator exists only
; because every consumer skips this block before reading the learnset.
